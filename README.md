============

Fundraising website for Managing Invitations, Sponsors and Donations.  Built using Python's Django Framework.  I did this as a volunteer 
for Daughters Elementary School over a one month period.  It has a lot of basic features and third-party integration.  The site allows 
Parents to manage Sponsors and Donations.  Parents can view the list of Donations by Student and send Email Reminders for Sponsors to make 
payments using PayPal Pay Button.  A Printable Donation Sheet is available for record keeping or submitting to the School.  Visitors can 
also make donations if they know the Student's Identifier or Donation Link, which can be posted to Facebook or Twitter.  A Photo Gallery 
is available which integrates with Picasa.  There is a simple Blog (with RSS Feed) to post updates.  A simple Contact Us form.  Google 
Calendar has been integrated to pull event dates.  There is a simple Message of the Week option.  There is also a rising Thermometer so 
visitors can keep track of the progress of the Fundraiser.  Results are calculated and graphed so users and admins can visually see how 
the Fundraiser is doing.

The Django admin interface allows administers to manage all the data collected through the site.
